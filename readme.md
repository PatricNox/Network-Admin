### TODO
Project is still under development.
Admin CLI is yet to be implemented, but is under construction!


### Usage Areas
Main-Frame Computer for collection of different computers used in the same network.

Maybe the "main PC" in a large server room?
> This is why this is created, by the way.

### Usage Instructions
This is written in PHP, a website back-end programming language which requires a website server for it to be run.

Extract Project files in your webservers listened folder and start the server, that is it!
* Apache
* Nginx
